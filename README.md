# Zoo API Design and Implementation

This project focuses on designing and implementing an API for a zoo, demonstrating the knowledge of designing and using APIs specified as a concrete class, an abstract class, and an interface. The project also involves creating derived classes from these APIs and utilizing them in a Zoo class.

## API Design

The API will be designed to provide resources related to zoo animals. It will include the following components:

1. **Concrete Class API (AnimalAPI):** This API will be implemented as a concrete class to provide specific functionalities for interacting with zoo animals.

2. **Abstract Class API (AbstractAnimalAPI):** An abstract class API will be designed to define common functionalities for zoo animals.

3. **Interface Class API (AnimalisticAPI):** This API will be implemented as an interface to provide a contract for interacting with zoo animals.

## Derived Classes

Three sets of derived classes will be created from the above APIs, resulting in a total of 9 derived classes (5 points each). These derived classes will demonstrate the use of the APIs in different contexts.

## Zoo Classes

Three zoo classes will be created to hold and display animal objects derived from the respective APIs:

1. **ZooAnimals:** This class will hold and display animal objects derived from AnimalAPI.

2. **ZooAbstractAnimals:** This class will hold and display animal objects derived from AbstractAnimalAPI.

3. **ZooAnimalisticAnimals:** This class will hold and display animal objects derived from AnimalisticAPI.

## Object API Demonstration

A fourth zoo class, ZooObjectAnimals, will be created to demonstrate that all animal objects created from the three APIs work with the Object API.

## Additional Information

The README.md file will be updated with detailed instructions on how to use the APIs and the derived classes, along with examples of their usage.
